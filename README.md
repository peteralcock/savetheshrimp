# Strategy for Every.org to Break into the WordPress Plugin Market

## Introduction
Every.org, a tech-for-good nonprofit, simplifies online giving by enabling donors to support over 1 million nonprofits through a single platform, with diverse payment methods like credit cards, cryptocurrency, stocks, and donor-advised funds (DAF). Its Charity API allows developers to create innovative giving experiences, making it a strong candidate for expanding into the WordPress plugin market. WordPress powers over 43% of websites, and many nonprofits rely on it for their online presence, presenting a significant opportunity for Every.org to reach developers and nonprofits. This report outlines a strategy for Every.org to develop and market a WordPress plugin, targeting developers to enhance its platform’s adoption and impact.
## Background
Every.org’s mission is to accelerate social impact by streamlining fundraising for nonprofits and donors. Since launching in March 2020, it has helped over 1,600 nonprofits raise $4.5 million, with 46% of donations being recurring. The platform offers no platform fees, only third-party transaction fees (e.g., 2.2% + $0.30 for credit cards), and provides an open-source donate button and a Charity API for developers. The WordPress plugin market is competitive, with established players like GiveWP offering robust donation solutions. However, Every.org’s unique features, such as multi-nonprofit donations and advanced payment methods, position it to carve out a niche by appealing to developers who value flexibility and innovation.
### Strategic Objectives:
 - Expand Reach: Integrate Every.org’s donation capabilities into WordPress sites, reaching nonprofits and donors using the platform.
 - Engage Developers: Attract WordPress developers with a user-friendly, well-documented plugin that leverages Every.org’s API.
 - Differentiate from Competitors: Highlight unique features to stand out in a crowded market.
 - Align with Mission: Maintain a free or low-cost plugin to support Every.org’s nonprofit ethos.

### Plugin Development Strategy
#### Plugin Features
To appeal to developers and nonprofits, the plugin should include:

 - Multi-Nonprofit Donation Forms: Allow users to create forms that enable donors to support multiple nonprofits in one transaction, a feature unique to Every.org.
 - Nonprofit Search Integration: Leverage the Nonprofit Search API to enable users to search and select from over 1 million 501(c)(3) organizations directly within WordPress.
 - Fundraiser Creation: Enable users to create and manage fundraising campaigns, using the Fundraisers API to track progress and share links.
 - Analytics Dashboard: Provide a WordPress dashboard displaying metrics like total donations, donor counts, and campaign performance, powered by API data.
 - Advanced Payment Methods: Support cryptocurrency, stock donations, DAF, and standard methods (e.g., PayPal, Apple Pay), setting it apart from competitors.
 - Customization Options: Offer shortcodes, Gutenberg blocks, and Elementor widgets for flexible integration with page builders.
 - Developer Hooks: Include actions and filters for developers to extend functionality, enhancing customization.

#### Technical Considerations

 - API Integration: Use Every.org’s Charity API (Every.org Charity API) for donation processing, nonprofit search, and fundraiser management. The plugin should handle public API keys for non-commercial use, ensuring compliance with API terms.
 - Open-Source Model: Release the plugin as open-source under the GPL license to align with WordPress.org guidelines and Every.org’s nonprofit mission.
 - Security: Implement best practices for handling sensitive data, such as encrypting API keys and securing donation transactions, to build trust.
 - Compatibility: Ensure compatibility with popular WordPress themes (e.g., Astra, GeneratePress) and page builders (e.g., Elementor, Divi).
 - Performance: Optimize API calls to minimize latency, caching nonprofit data where appropriate to enhance user experience.

#### Development Approach

 - In-House vs. Agency: Every.org, as a tech-focused nonprofit, may have the capacity to develop the plugin in-house. Alternatively, partnering with a reputable WordPress development agency could accelerate development while ensuring quality.
 - Timeline: Aim for an initial release within 6-9 months, starting with core features (donation forms, nonprofit search) and adding advanced features (analytics, fundraisers) in subsequent updates.
 - Testing: Conduct thorough testing across WordPress versions, themes, and plugins to ensure compatibility and reliability.

#### Marketing Strategy
Target Audience
The primary audience is WordPress developers, including:

 - Freelance Developers: Building sites for nonprofits and seeking easy-to-use donation solutions.
 - Agencies: Managing multiple nonprofit clients and needing scalable tools.
 - Nonprofit Staff: With basic WordPress knowledge, looking for plug-and-play solutions.
